BibleGPT 

Inspired by a friend to develop a bible that allows the user to choose bible verses and have them explained with the power of GPT-4. Planning to use SpaCy to tokenize verses and use GPT-4 to explain them.
I hope to include authentication and a database to store user's favorite verses. Currently in development.

Current Progress (October 16, 2023)
* Working API retrival for Bible Books and # of Chapters
* Developing Chapters and Verses
* Making UI look nice with Tailwind and ShadCn Component Library
